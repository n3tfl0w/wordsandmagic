I’ve said it before, there are some games that stick with you for a long time. You know the ones, the ones that you compare other games to like Mass Effect, the games that you look up the soundtrack like the Halo series, the ones where you buy the spin off book series like EVE, or the games that you look up the artists afterwards - exactly what I did in the case of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag.

I loved Black Flag, but that’s a post for another day. One of the best things about this game is how it looks, and that’s in no small part due to Rapahel Lacoste, who is Ubisoft's Brand Art Director on the Assassin’s Creed Franchise[^1].

Its art direction like that, that really sets the game up to look so good. I immediately fell in love with it. So I had to look up the rest of his work. And I wasn’t disappointed at all - some absolutely amazing work - truly beautiful art.

In particular I love his futuristic cityscapes.

And his work crosses into all my favourite genres: sci-fi, fantasy, and even ruin porn.
