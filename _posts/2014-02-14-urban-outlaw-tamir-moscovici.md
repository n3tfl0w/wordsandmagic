## Urban Outlaw by Tamir Moscovici
***
Caught this video today on vimeo - one of my petrol inclined friends sent it on to me. URBAN OUTLAW is a portrait of Magnus Walker, the rebel Porsche customizer who turned a hobby into an obsession, and an obsession into a successful business. Its a beautifully shot short documentary about a man with a tonne of vision and love of one particular thing - Porsche 911's. Well worth a watch if you have 30 mins.
