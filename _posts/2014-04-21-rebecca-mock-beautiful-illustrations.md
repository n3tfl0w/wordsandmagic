Rebecca Mock is an illustrator and comic artist from Brooklyn in the US. I came across her subtly animated illustrations on [tumblr](http://rebeccamock.tumblr.com/) and immediately loved them. Very similar to cinemagraphs that are popular at the minute but somehow with more life and character.

Rebecca's other illustration work is just as full of character and life and more importantly [available to purchase as beautiful prints](http://society6.com/RebeccaMock/prints).

There's a really good interview with Rebecca over on [Youth Designer](http://www.youthedesigner.com/2014/03/06/interview-with-rebecca-mock/) that is worth a read too.
