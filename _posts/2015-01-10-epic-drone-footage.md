## Epic Drone footage
***

Drones with mounted cameras are showing us extraordinary places and events from unfamiliar angles.

The video above is a mixture of drone and other footage from Chernobyl and it's nearest city - Pripyat. Abandoned after the disaster at the power plant it is now one of the most interesting places on earth. A city being reclaimed by nature. 

A bit more about the movie from its maker [Danny Cooke](https://vimeo.com/112681885):

> During my stay, I met so many amazing people, one of whom was my guide Yevgen, also known as a 'Stalker'. We spent the week together exploring Chernobyl and the nearby abandoned city of Pripyat. There was something serene, yet highly disturbing about this place. Time has stood still and there are memories of past happenings floating around us.

Great video, but wow do I wish it had a better soundtrack.

### Fireworks

The next video is from [Jos Stiglingh](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBzrTEellANJndKutPrHwjw) and its a beautiful trip into the middle of a fireworks show.

Again, not an angle you'll usually see that kind of event from.

### The Garden of Ireland

The next video hasn't got the same number of views as the above but it is definitely one of the most beautiful showcases of drone footage. It's from Ireland, and its mostly from a county called Wicklow. The county's nickname is the garden of Ireland, and a place I know well from quite a bit of hiking over the years.

### Hong Kong democracy protests

2014 seemed to be the year of the mass protest and the next video shows The Hong Kong protests. The footage at night is particularly good. About the video from Youtube.

> Thousands of demonstrators turned out in downtown Hong Kong on September 29 to support a protest over Beijing’s decision to reject calls for open nominations for the election of Hong Kong’s chief executive in 2017. Demonstrators on Monday called for the resignation of Hong Kong’s top official CY Leung after he branded Occupy Central, one of the organizing groups, as “unlawful”.
