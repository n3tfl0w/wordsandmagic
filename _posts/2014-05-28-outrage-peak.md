Twitter broke out in outrage this morning (and I'm starting to wonder if it's for anything else at the minute) about The Summit's announcement that they're hiring 40 graduates ahead of their upcoming event. The catch - you need to have a first class honours degree from one of our Universities (TCD, UCD, UCC, NUI, DCU, or UL). To apply from an IT, you require an additional masters degree.

In short: a company that organises conferences around the subject of the web has a fairly crap hiring policy that they've made public. Even shorter: nothing happened of any interest to 99% of us.

I differ from many of you on twitter in that I have no problem with this policy. But I also, along with many of you, know that many smart and hard working people didn't go to a university, or didn't achieve a first class honours degree. Will the Summit miss some great candidates? Yes. Does having a first from a University guarantee they'll be great candidates? Of course not.

The number one complaint I saw is that this policy is somehow elitist or contains some class bias. Bull. Shit. I would love to see a breakdown of socio-economic groups in terms of grades but I'd be nothing short of stunned if it was heavily weighted towards the landed gentry. (Money helps, we all know this, but it is no substitute for talent, intelligence, and hard work.) I have to think that at worst it punishes those who didn't live near a city with a University.

So, if working for The Summit was your goal in life - I would reassess your goals to be honest but if it was - it is an achievable goal. If you wanted to do a Masters degree in DIT, it would cost between 3,000 and 6,000 euro. Is this a large amount of money? Yes. Is it a large amount of money when you consider it's for something worthwhile and going towards you meeting your goal in life of working for the Summit? No. 

We're very lucky here in Ireland that these are attainable goals. 

Normally, I ignore a lot of the constant outrage and quickly unfollow or block those involved, but this time I have a bit of a problem - many of those complaining about this policy are people that I respect and like to see tweeting. However, for almost 100% of those complaining this is a non story. It doesn't matter to their lives and will not interfere with their careers in any way. There are more worthwhile issues. 

P.S. (Yes I get the irony of being outraged at the outrage.)
