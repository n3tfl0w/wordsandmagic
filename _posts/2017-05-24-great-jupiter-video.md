## Approaching Jupiter

***

Video Composition & Copyright: Peter Rosén et al.; Music: The Awakening by Clemens Ruh

The video itself is not what I expected it to be - I'll let APOD explain:

>  ... a team of 91 amateur astrophotographers took over 1,000 pictures of Jupiter from the Earth with the resulting images aligned and digitally merged into the featured time-lapse video. 

I'm really in awe of this video, it's just so well put together. Do yourself a favour and hit the full screen button.
