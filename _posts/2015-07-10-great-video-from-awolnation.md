## Great Video from Awolnation

***

Awolnation just dropped a new video for one of their songs from the album Run. The song is I Am, and you may have heard it recently on the newest Welcome to the World of Red Bull video. I’ve been a massive fan of Awolnation since they exploded onto the scene with Sail - [https://youtu.be/tgIqecROs5M](https://youtu.be/tgIqecROs5M). 

On a slightly different note, Red Bull have regularly been picking favourite songs of mine for their Welcome to the World of Red Bull videos - like the song above for [2015](https://youtu.be/kKPtLTg31Mg) and M83 with Outro for [2013](https://youtu.be/hoSVI7ovEIw). Though 2014 was a slight blip in the good song choices…
