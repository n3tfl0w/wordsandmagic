## Wanderers - A beautiful short film by Erik Wernquist
***

Is there a better voice than Carl Sagan? I’m not sure.

On [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/108650530) Erik Wernquist talks a bit more about his film:

> Wanderers is a vision of humanity's expansion into the Solar System, based on scientific ideas and concepts of what our future in space might look like, if it ever happens. The locations depicted in the film are digital recreations of actual places in the Solar System, built from real photos and map data where available.
