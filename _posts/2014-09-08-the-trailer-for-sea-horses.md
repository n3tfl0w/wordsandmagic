## The trailer for Sea Horses: The Movie
***

Wait! Don't watch the video just yet - let me tell you this first... I cannot tell whether the voiceover is some ironic in-joke or just really, really bad. Though the visuals more than make up for it, so go ahead and watch it.

A bit more about the movie from Doug Gardner and Jared Lloyd:

> The story behind the wild horses of the Outer Banks is one of epic proportions. Sand and salt, winds and tides have come together here along these ribbons of sand that we call barrier islands, to shape and mold one of the most unique horses on Earth. Their past is a shadowy one, punctuated by shipwrecks and lost colonies, all dating back to the age of exploration. Through hurricanes and nor’easters, tidal surges and drought, these horses have not so much survived as they have thrived in the face of the very worst of Poseidon’s wrath.

Indeed.
