## Willem Dafoe set to music? Yes please...
***

What a great voice Willem Dafoe has... instantly recognisable. 

So I had to find this piece from the new History Channel's TV ad and some creative google searches later - here it is. It's called Ring and it's by British duo Mint Royale and it was released a few months back. 

While I love it, I had to hear more so after a bit more searching around I discovered this gem - [NERDIST PODCAST #173: WILLEM DAFOE](http://www.nerdist.com/pepisode/nerdist-podcast-173-willem-dafoe/) Its the inspiration for this song and very much worth a listen.
