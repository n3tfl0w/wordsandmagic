Arriving into St Lucia by plane might be one of the more memorable window seats I've ever had. A beautiful green island with some spectacular geography sticking out of the perfect blue ocean. Flying from Miami to St Lucia was a quick flight to what might be my new favourite island on the planet.

So it was the second part of our honeymoon - the first being in Orlando - and we wanted to head to somewhere special. Some of our friends and family had been to St Lucia before and it came highly recommended, they stayed at the north of the island at the Body Holiday resort. We fancied somewhere a little different and our travel agent in trailfinders recommended The Capella at Marigot Bay. We were glad they did because it was amazing.

On arrival in St Lucia, we had arranged a transfer to the hotel and immediately found it just outside the airport. But we were met by another person - a representative of Capella Marigot Bay who gave us some water and hot towels and asked what drink we'd like on arrival. Pretty special start to the trip. After a journey of about an hour, up the spectacular east side of the island we arrived at the hotel and everything was swiftly taken care of. Bags disappeared, drinks arrived and helpful staff ensured a quick check in. We were given a tour of the Bay, including the marina, and then brought to our beautiful (and well stocked) room.

The reviews of this hotel were not lying about the stairs! This resort is built into the side of the bay and to maximise views of the area the chalet type buildings go vertically. We were on the top of one of these buildings with some pretty spectacular views of the bay and marina. Honestly, waking up here was one of the most special weeks of my life. The rub was that to get to the room though we had to negotiate about 4 flights of stairs. We became excellent packers, bringing everything we'd need for the day down with us. 

The pool was refreshingly cold first thing in the morning, with a very nice poolside bar. We shared a fair few cocktails sitting poolside enjoying the weather or reading books (or grabbing a sneaky nap). Complementary water was brought around regularly, some snacks, and coconuts too. The food served here was great for a small (or bigger) bite for lunch.

The other restaurants on site were a smaller place down in the marina - perfect for pizza/beer and where we watched the NFL playoffs when we arrived, the Rum Cave - which had a lot of rum that I'd never heard of and also served food, and the main restaurant which is where we ate breakfast most days and ate dinner a few times. This had great views of the marina and bay, and we were served very good food by some super friendly staff. Honestly, I loved it.

We really wanted to relax on this trip so that's what we did most days - split between the beach on the other side of the bay and the pool. We caught up on our reading and drank a good bit. I favoured the local lager Piton while my wife enjoyed some more colourful concoctions. However we did do one pretty amazing trip down the west coast in a catamaran to the islands very famous Pitons. 

We were picked up at the marina at Marigot Bay a little later than planned but as soon as we set off we were amazed by St Lucia's beautiful coastline. It really looked picture perfect. We slowly made our way down the coast passing by some amazing hotels and scenery. We changed to a slightly bigger catamaran at Soufriere and then made our way to the snorkelling area beside the Sugar Beach resort in the shadow of the Pitons. Neither of us swam so we relaxed on the boat with some drinks and food while chatting to some of the other guests. The journey back was at sunset, and really made the trip very memorable. A very worthwhile cruise.

We travelled a little around St Lucia but mostly relaxed around our hotel and around Marigot Bay. I would have liked to see more of the island but with only a week, R&R was the priority. Hopefully we get to head back there some day.
