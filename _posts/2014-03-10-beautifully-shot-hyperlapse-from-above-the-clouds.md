## Beautifully Shot Hyperlapse from Above the Clouds
***

Stumbled across this blog post from Matthew Vandeputte on [why he always chooses the window seat...](http://tjoez.zenfolio.com/blog/2014/3/why-i-always-choose-the-windowseat)

He created a beautiful hyperlapse on a recent flight and its well worth a quick watch. Also took some beautiful photographs too that are worth a look in this [gallery](http://tjoez.zenfolio.com/p412540216). That first shot is particularly beautiful.
