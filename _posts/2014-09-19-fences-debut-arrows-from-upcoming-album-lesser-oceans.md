## Fences debut Arrows from upcoming album Lesser Oceans
***

Fences released a couple of songs from their new album Lesser Oceans (to be released Jan 15 next year). The song above is Arrows, the collaboration with the also Seattle based Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. This is not the first time that the band and Macklemore and Ryan Lewis have gotten together - they've collaborated before on songs and most recently on Macklemore and Ryan Lewis's The Heist.

Another song that Fences released from their upcoming album is The Lake, and it's a great song. Up on YouTube now:

Rolling Stone magazine [spoke to Macklemore on the Fences collaboration here](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/macklemore-faces-the-critics-in-fences-arrows-video-20140811) and Billboard managed to speak to both of them [here about their recent collaborations and Arrows in particular](http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6190814/fences-macklemore-and-ryan-lewis-arrows), and they're both worth reading, especially to see how they relate to each other:

> “Fences is a good friend," said Macklemore. "He’s fu---d up in the same way that I’m f----d up. Because of that, our lives relate beyond the music. I’ve always admired his talent for illustrating with words and evoking imagery. We’ve made a bunch of stuff together over the years and this here song about Arrows is my favorite one we’ve done."

The song is doing the rounds in America and all around here in Europe too. It should do really well,
