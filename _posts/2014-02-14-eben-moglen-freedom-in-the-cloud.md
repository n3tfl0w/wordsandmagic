## Eben Moglen - Freedom in The Cloud
***

I've written about Eben Moglen and how much I love his talks before but I was recently pointed to this by Cory Doctorow on Twitter. Even though this talk is from 2010 Eben hits all the right notes with regards to the privacy issues we're hitting right now. Doctorow called it [prescient](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/473537049694572544) and I have to agree. Definitely putting a Raspberry PI on the shopping list. 

I have a favourite talk from Eben. It's called "Innovation under Austerity" and was delivered as the Freedom to Connect Conference in 2012. So after the talk above, check this one out.
