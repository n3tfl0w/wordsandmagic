            <p>I started this project as a place to write. I didn't know which direction I wanted to go when I started it, but it was inpsired by <a href="http://twitter.com/retinart">Alex Charchar's</a> <a href="http://short.retinart.net/an-essay-a-day/">An Essay a Day</a> project. Now, I focus on storytelling, be that in art, graphic design, music, video, movies, games or well... anything really. I love the stories behind everything.</p>
