Woops. Looks like the link you've clicked hasn't worked... Google thinks maybe it was supposed to be this link:

If not, I've been doing a bit of housecleaning and unfortunately this page might not have been up to scratch, so I deleted it - my apologies! Here's a picture of a puppy by Andr√© Spieker to make up for it...

Take a look at my [table of contents here](http://wordsandmagic.com) to see if there's anything that interests you.

By the way, the Google magic above was inspired by [Donovan Hutchinson's excellent article on better 404 pages in Smashing Magazine.](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/12/a-better-404-page/)
